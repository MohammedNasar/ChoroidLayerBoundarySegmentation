## Choroid Analysis Tool for Modeling and Quantifying Biomarkers in Vision-Threatening Retinal Disorders (e.g., Age-Related Macular Degeneration and Central Serous Chorioretinopathy)
## A Deep Learning Approach for Choroid Layer Boundary and Choroid Vessel Segmentation

This advanced machine learning tool utilizes a 3D ResUNet architecture to accurately segment choroid layer boundaries in swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) images. Trained on SS-OCT datasets with expert-labeled choroid layer boundary images, the model can:

    Precisely model the choroid layer by accurately delineating the boundaries between:
        . Choroid and retina
        . Choroid and sclera
    
    The main function to initiate the GUI: "Choroid_Layer_Segmentation_GUI.m"
    
    Due to privacy constraints, machine learning models based on single or multi-epoch aggregation are not available for sharing. However, if you're interested, feel free to reach out to me at <mohammednasari@gmail>. I can assist in building a new model by curating fresh data and developing a GUI for manually marking choroid layer boundaries in OCT images, which can then be used to prepare paired images for training the model.

The model is designed to provide accurate and reliable segmentation of these key ocular structures, supporting diagnosing and monitoring choroid-related eye conditions.
