## 3D ResUNet Model for Choroid Layer Segmentation

This advanced machine learning model leverages a 3D ResUNet architecture to precisely delineate choroid layer boundaries in swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) images. The model has been meticulously trained on a dataset of SS-OCT scans paired with expertly labeled choroid images, enabling it to:

1. Efficiently identify the choroid layer
2. Robustly demarcate the boundaries between:
   - Choroid and retina
   - Choroid and sclera

The model's design focuses on accuracy and reliability in segmenting these critical ocular structures, potentially aiding in the diagnosis and monitoring of various eye conditions affecting the choroid.
